# Telecom Systems

*A collection of tools and implementations related to telecommunications systems and signal-processing concepts.*

## Overview

This repository contains code and  simulations pertaining to various topics in telecommunications systems. This project aims to provide practical, hands-on examples and implementations of modulation schemes, channel modeling, signal transmission, and system analysis.

## Features

Implementations of communication system modules in Matlab like channel models 

Simulation frameworks for analyzing system performance under noise, fading, and interference

Plotting and visualisation of signals and system responses

Educational code structure allowing modification of parameters and experimentation for learning and research

## Report

This code was written as part of a group project excercise, and all information needed about its function is included in the `Telecom_Systems_Report.pdf` file. 

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to my friend and co-student Georgios Theologis for collaborating with me on this group project. Thanks also to all my professors who were a source of inspiration for exploring these concepts in more depth.
